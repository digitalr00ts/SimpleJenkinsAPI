# SimpleJenkinsAPI
Lightweight wrapper for the CloudBees Jenkins API

The motivation for tool, is the current solutions have mainance issues and/or design decision that did not work for some use cases.
and to create a library that is low effort to maintain.
The result is a simple library to interact with the Jenkins API easier without abstracting away the API.
